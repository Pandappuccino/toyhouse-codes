# Welcome to Pandappuccino's Toyhouse Code Compendium!
These are codes I've created for personal use that I've decided to share with people.  Some are for services, some are profiles, others are miscellaneous codes that I slapped together for whatever reason.

## Q: What are the rules to using these codes?
Just don't frankenstein the codes and claim them as your own, and credit me, Pandappuccino, for the codes.  Each code has a permission line in it linking back to my account.  Don't remove or comment it out, and we're golden.

## Q: Do you take code requests?
Not right now.  My Bootstrap is a little rusty and I don't want to try to create something for someone without knowing if it will actually work as intended.  There's a lot of trial-and-error in getting these codes right.

## Q: I want to leave you a tip, where can I do that?
You can either donate to [my Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/pandappuccino) or [my PayPal](https://paypal.me/PastelPandaArt).  I'd appreciate it a lot if you did.
